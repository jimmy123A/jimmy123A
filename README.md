### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jim from Greece and i do UI / UX Design and full stack Web and Mobile Development. I really enjoying learning languages and libraries/frameworks like React and React Native as well as work in NodeJS for any sort of backend integration. I also enjoy wireframing, ui, ux and design in general. You can check my portfolio website here https://myportfolio-49006.web.app/
